      <p>I have many cousins that are 3 years old or younger. The kids usually watch counting challenges videos on YouTube during lunch and dinner time, for the kids to silently eat. 
        Some of the parents ask me if I can do a counter on some custom devices so that their children can focus on that, instead of being annoying and interrupt them. This is the 
        purpose to create an Arduino project that basically counts the number of times the button is pressed.</p>

      <h5>This project uses Arduino and natural language processing (NLP)</h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Arduinos microcontroller and natural language processing are the two significant IT technologies that is relevant to this project.  
        Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino has been the core of thousands of projects,
        from simple everyday objects to complex machines. Natural language processing is another technologies that could be included in the project. 
        It is a branch in Artificial Intelligence, where it gives the computers the ability to detect understand texts and spoken words like human beings. </p>

      <h4><b>Our Team</b></h4>
      <p>I am easily stressed and having a teammate with a strong mental could really help me with my emotions. I am also not a natural team leader, however I can have many interesting idea to contribute to the team. 
        It would be best if I can have teammates that cover most of the irrelevant tasks for me, such as asking teachers for suggestions, or designing the report or PowerPoint presentation, 
        so that I can focus on critical thinking and contribute the best idea possible for any project. In a project, I believe that I can take more work to myself, such as covering the longest writing part in a report, 
        or creating the first prototype for the team. Therefore, it is best if my teammates can cover my weakness, then it can be assured that I will contribute my best in any project.</p>

        <p>Dat Nguyen (s3894433):</p>
        <p>“The Arduino project is a great idea as the parent will have another simple toy to play with their kid. Moreover, this could attract the kid to stay away from mobile devices. However, there are some problems 
        with safety here, how about the little baby under 3 years old, do they allow to play with this toy due to their awareness is not enough and it can cause some issues, for instance, they can bite it…”</p>

        <p>“The project of Arduino is a fantastic and interesting idea for kids since most of the parents these days tend to let their kids deal with technology too soon such as phone, iPad and more, it might cause 
        them addiction if they do not have a strict schedule of using them. What if the Arduino can be also considered a fun toy for children? In addition to work as a counter, it could have more things to do like having 
        alphabetical games, playing some kid music or more perhaps. Furthermore, the project should provide some safety information since it is the most important thing when dealing with kids who have no awareness.”</p>
