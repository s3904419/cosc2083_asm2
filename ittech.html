          <p>Arduinos microcontroller and natural language processing are the two significant IT technologies that is relevant to this project.  
            Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino has been the core of thousands of projects,
            from simple everyday objects to complex machines. The community of makers consist of different types of people - students, programmers, professionals, etc… 
            Arduino was created at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. 
            This is why introducing Arduino to toddlers can have a huge impact in their lives, because from a programmed simple game for kids, they can create new projects themselves when they get older.</p>
          <p>IT projects using Arduinos board are mostly on a small scale, mostly created by university students doing a particular assignment. Microcontrollers was a course that I studied in my previous university,
            specifically Raspberry Pi and Arduinos. However, the number of jobs related to microcontrollers are not as popular as other sections of IT. This project is also a simple creation, but it can introduce Arduinos, 
            or microcontrollers in general, to a completely new group of audiences, that is parents and toddlers. Xbox or PlayStation machines might be too expensive for some parents, or adults simply do not want to spend too 
            much on a game for their children. Another point is that there is a limited number of toys or games for toddlers. Arduino boards are affordable, and there are various codes available online that are interesting games 
            or entertainment for children. </p>
          <p>The project already has an online prototype on Tinkercad. It contains an LCD screen displaying a counter and a running timer. Many improvements and upgrades can be done from this initial prototype. 
            An example stated earlier was too add a microphone that can detect and count the number of times a particular word is said. This variation can create extra use for the Arduino, such as counting the number of curse words 
            being said in the house for one day, so parents would raise awareness and avoid speaking bad language in front of their children. Another interesting idea is that the microphone is set close to a baby after the kid speaks 
            their first word, to determine how many words they speak in their first day possible. This could be a fun fact that follows the children for their remaining life.</p>
          <p>Natural language processing is another technologies that could be included in the project. It is a branch in Artificial Intelligence, where it gives the computers the ability to detect understand texts and spoken words 
            like human beings. Natural language processing are being applied in many fields, especially Google. Google has such a powerful natural language AI to support different apps, such as Google Translate or Google Search. 
            Speech recognition is the most important part needed for my project, since the target audiences are toddlers, the language they speak might have incorrect grammar or pronunciations. The tasks for this project is simpler, 
            only to detect how many words are being said. In a few years’ time, I hope to develop my skills and upgrade the functions of the natural language processing power in the project, to at least fully able to convert speech to text, 
            and from there automatically provide a response from the keywords heard. </p>
          <p>It is mentioned that this project would have impacts on toddlers and elementary students. Arduinos can be a crucial part for kids and their imagination for a long time. The targeted audience for this project is toddlers and parents. 
            When those children grow up and go to elementary or middle school, they can reuse the Arduinos and start their own simple projects. Hundreds of projects are made and published by 8-15 year-old students. Arduinos can become the main 
            entertainment for students instead of smartphones and gaming. It can be seen that most children nowadays have a personal smartphone at a young age, and it might affect their imagination when kids usually use their smartphone for social 
            media and gaming. In my daily life, perhaps friends of my parents might see the potential of this project, and contact me for a test product. It would give me a chance to promote my Arduino program, and also to create new connections 
            to the parents and their children. 	</p>
